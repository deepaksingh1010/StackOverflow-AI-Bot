# StackOverflow-AI-Bot

# Project Overview
This project aims to enhance customer service chatbots using fine-tuned machine learning models on the Stack Overflow dataset. The model will tackle real-world technical issues by improving the chatbots' ability to understand and generate technical content effectively.

# Project Details
## Data Source
We utilized the Stack Overflow dataset for this project, which offers a rich source of user interactions involving technical problems and their solutions. This dataset is ideal due to:

Its extensive coverage of various technology fields.
The broad spectrum of topics it encompasses.
Its potential to improve customer service chatbots with better natural language understanding.

## Business Problem Addressed
Our fine-tuned model will tackle the business problem of enhancing the efficiency of customer service chatbots. By improving their ability to comprehend and respond to technical queries, these chatbots can:

Reduce response times.
Improve customer satisfaction.
Allow human support teams to focus on more complex issues.

# LoRA and QLoRA
## LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

A technique for enhancing large pre-trained models, such as GPT and BERT, through selective parameter adjustments.
LoRA introduces low-rank updates to model weights during training, reducing the computational and resource requirements.

## QLoRA (Quantization LoRA)

Focuses on reducing memory consumption for fine-tuning large language models on GPUs with limited memory.
Uses 4-bit quantization to optimize memory usage and employs LoRA to counterbalance the quantization errors.
Helps maintain model performance with minimal computational resources.

# Instruction Fine-Tuning
Instruction fine-tuning involves training a pre-trained model with a dataset that has specific tasks, enhancing its performance for those tasks. This approach differs from unsupervised pre-training by targeting specific tasks and instructions.
